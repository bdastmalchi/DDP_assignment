This simple appliation predicts stopping distance of a car based on its speed. 

Prediction algorithm fits a polynomial model to the data.

Data uses cars dataset embeded into R, which is taken from 
**Ezekiel, M. (1930) Methods of Correlation Analysis. Wiley**.

Application shows the predicted distance in feets as a text output. A plot also shows the fitted polynomial and the predicted distance vs input speed as a red symbol on the fitted curve.

## input parameters

1- Polynomial fit degree: Shows order of the polynomial to be used for fitting. The polynomial digree is limited to integers from 1 to 4.

2- Speed: Defines the car speed (in mph) for which the the stopping distance (in feets) must be predicted. Speed can vary from 4 to 25 mph.
